# Coin Detection and Counting

This project demonstrates automatic coin detection and counting using image processing techniques in Python. The main script, `coin_counter.py`, processes the image `coins.png` to identify and count the number of coins present.

## Features

- Loads and processes an image containing coins
- Detects coins using computer vision methods
- Counts and displays the number of coins found

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Install the required packages:
   ```powershell
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python coin_counter.py
   ```
3. The script will process `coins.png` and output the number of coins detected.

## Files

- `coin_counter.py`: Main script for coin detection and counting
- `coins.png`: Sample image containing coins

## Notes

- You can replace `coins.png` with your own image for testing.
- Make sure the image is in the same directory as the script.
