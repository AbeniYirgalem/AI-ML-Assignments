# Coin Detection Assignment

This project demonstrates coin detection in images using Python and OpenCV. The main script, `coin_detection.py`, processes the image `coins.png` to identify and count coins.

## Files

- `coin_detection.py`: Main Python script for coin detection.
- `coins.png`: Sample image containing coins to be detected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

Run the script to detect coins in the provided image:

```bash
python coin_detection.py
```

## Output

The script will display the original image with detected coins highlighted and print the number of coins found.

## Notes

- You can replace `coins.png` with your own image for detection.
- Adjust parameters in the script for different lighting or coin sizes.
