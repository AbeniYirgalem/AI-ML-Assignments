# Image Blurring Project

This project demonstrates basic image blurring techniques using Python. It provides a simple script to apply blurring effects to an image file.

## Files

- `image_blurring.py`: Main Python script for image blurring operations.
- `trex.png`: Sample image used for demonstration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Place your image file (e.g., `trex.png`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python image_blurring.py
   ```
3. The script will display the original and blurred images using matplotlib.

## Features

- Reads an image from file
- Applies blurring techniques (e.g., average, Gaussian, median)
- Displays results for comparison

## Customization

- You can change the input image by replacing `trex.png` with your own image file.
- Modify the script to adjust blur parameters or add new blurring methods.
