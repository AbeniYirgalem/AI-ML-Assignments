# Image Arithmetic Assignment

This project demonstrates basic image arithmetic operations using Python. The main script, `image_arithmetic.py`, performs operations such as addition, subtraction, and blending on images. The sample image used is `trex.png`.

## Files

- `image_arithmetic.py`: Main Python script for image arithmetic operations.
- `trex.png`: Sample image used for demonstration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
2. Place `trex.png` in the same directory as `image_arithmetic.py`.

## Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python image_arithmetic.py
```

## Features

- Image addition
- Image subtraction
- Image blending

## Output

The script displays the results of each arithmetic operation using OpenCV's image display functions.
