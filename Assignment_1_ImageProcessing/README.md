# Image Processing Basics

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using Python. It is designed for educational purposes as part of an AI & ML assignment.

## Project Structure

- `image_processing_basics.py`: Main Python script containing image processing code.
- `mountain_nyala.jpg`, `trex.png`: Sample images used for processing.
- `new_image.png`: Output image generated by the script.

## Features

- Loads and processes images using Python libraries (e.g., OpenCV, PIL, or similar).
- Applies basic image transformations and manipulations.
- Saves processed images to disk.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or compatible version
- Common image processing libraries (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV)

## How to Run

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```powershell
   pip install pillow opencv-python
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python image_processing_basics.py
   ```
3. Check the output image (`new_image.png`) in the project folder.

## Usage

- Modify `image_processing_basics.py` to experiment with different image processing techniques.
- Replace sample images with your own to test other scenarios.
