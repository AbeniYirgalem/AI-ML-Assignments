# MNIST CNN Assignment

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- Builds a CNN model using Keras/TensorFlow
- Trains the model and evaluates its accuracy
- Visualizes training history and results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Install the required packages:
   ```powershell
   pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python mnist_cnn.py
   ```

## File Structure

- `mnist_cnn.py`: Main script for training and evaluating the CNN on MNIST

## Output

- Model training and evaluation metrics are printed to the console
- Training history plots are displayed
