# LSTM Character Generator

This project implements a character-level text generator using an LSTM neural network in Python. The model is trained to generate text one character at a time, learning from a given corpus.

## Features

- Character-level text generation
- LSTM-based neural network
- Customizable training corpus
- Generates novel text sequences

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Place your training text in the appropriate location or modify the script to use your own corpus.
2. Run `text_generator.py` to train the model and generate text.

```
powershell.exe python text_generator.py
```

## File Structure

- `text_generator.py`: Main script for training and generating text using LSTM.

## Customization

- You can modify the script to change the number of LSTM layers, units, or training epochs.
- Adjust the input text to experiment with different writing styles or domains.

## Output

- The script will print generated text to the console after training.
